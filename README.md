# AraneticWS
AraneticWS is a transliteration web application. Aranetic is a writing system I developed based on the Arabela language. It is derived from elements of phonetics, Hangeul, and Linear B. The programs inside take in an input of Arabela written in the standard English Roman Alphabet and outputs its transcription in Aranetic form.

Please try it out here! https://jeugarte.github.io/AraneticWS/

Please make sure the input follows these restrictions in order to properly transliterate:
  - lowercase all characters
  - add spaces to break words
  - follow Roman Alphabet restrictions on Arabela
      - consonant characters allowed:
          - s, sh, h
          - m, n
          - p, t, k
          - w, j, r
      - vowel characters allowed:
          - a, e, i, o, u
          - combinations of diphthongs
  - CV or CVV syllabic forms allowed only
  - remove all punctuation
  - refresh the page to transliterate again
